# StarlingEx
This package contains several extensions that expand the functionality of their base Starling classes, and some new original classes as well that I hope you will find useful. The highlights are as follows.

## ApertureSprite
An ApertureSprite is a container, much like its base Sprite class, with the additional functionality of allowing you to assign a color to it. All children which implement IAperture will automatically have their colors multiplied by the parent color, unless its apertureLock property is set to true. Changing colors in this manner is very fast and efficient and does not require additional draw calls, although it is limited in that it can only reduce the color in a channel, much like how making the aperture in a camera smaller can only reduce the amount of light coming in. If you wanted to increase the color in a channel, that would require the use of a color offset filter, which would need additional draw calls. The Starling Manual has an excellent [explanation of how this works.](https://manual.starling-framework.org/en/#_the_goal)
